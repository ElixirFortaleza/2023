## Strategies for a Successful Presentation

There are numerous ways to deliver a successful presentation. Here, we have' highlighted four aspects that we believe are essential for delivering an effective technical talk:

1. **Context:** Striking the right balance in establishing the backdrop is essential. Since not everyone may be well-versed in your subject, it's important to provide context and bring everyone up to speed. Allocate time to explain the problem's context, but be mindful not to overdo it. This requires rehearsal. It's common to either delve excessively into context or skip it entirely. Ensure your key points are clear and concise, allowing your audience to stay engaged as you transition to the central theme.

2. **Takeaway:** Concentrate on conveying one or two significant concepts. Your audience will only retain a limited number of ideas from your talk. Identify these core concepts and build your presentation around them.

3. **Tone:** Be genuine and captivating! People have varied natural styles, some serious and others humorous. Be authentic to yourself. However, when uncertain about incorporating content, lean towards the side of being engaging and entertaining.

4. **Slides:** Opt for prominent and striking fonts. Prioritize high contrast. Your slides should be legible not only from the back of the room.

Regarding the use of slides:

- Restrict the content on each slide.
- MAXIMIZE FONT SIZE as much as possible.
- Employ colors with strong contrasts.
- Technical content is most effectively presented with ample contrast and sizable fonts.
- Be cautious with colored syntax highlighting that might lack contrast against your chosen background.
- Did I emphasize the use of LARGE FONTS enough? If you're uncertain, aim for slides that can be comfortably read from your laptop screen from a distance of thirty feet.

Sustain your audience's engagement by designing slides that remain legible even from the rear of the room.
